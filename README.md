## Self Introduction
### TLDR?
     No problem. Here are some keywords that I feel describe me:

     ####Soft Skills
     - Quick Learner
     - Team Leader & Collaborator
     - Motivated Worker
     ####Hard Skills
     - Erlang
     - C++
     - JavaScript
     - Python
### A Longer Intro.
#### My Beginnings
  Hi! I'm Benjamin Hansen. I am from Southern Utah. I became interested in computer science in high school where I took 5 computer courses. I went on a mission for my church, [[https://churchofjesuschrist.org][The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in Georgia, worked construction for 4 months, and then started my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at [[https://www.byui.edu/][Brigham Young University - Idaho]]. I chose Computer Science because of how it peaked my interest in my web design & development and programming course in high school. What really brought me confidence that I could do well in this field was from achieving the highest grade on the final exam of my entire programming class.

  Ever since, programming paradigms and concepts have come easily to me. I can quickly learn languages and write programs in them. What I really love is Erlang. I feel like Erlang is almost as easy as Python. My initial solution to a problem is not hard to implement in Erlang, whereas in other languages it may take many revisions to my initial solution to solve the problem. I've created many modules with many functions in Erlang, for a class and on my free time. I prefer doing mathematical algorithms and functions in Erlang. I love its scalability and simplicity.

  I've also used my C++ knowledge in 5 semesters of courses. After learning Python during my Machine Learning course, I learned R within a short span of time to do the final project. I feel confident I can learn any software and accomplish any task given to me.


# Side Projects
## Automation of Summer Workflow
  This summer I didn't work like last because of COVID-19 and my desire to prepare for my future. I had a long list of goals I wanted to accomplish and skills I wanted to refine. Here are just a few of them:

  - Prepare for Calculus II: Refine my knowledge of Calculus
  - Increase Job Skills: Learn whatever I need to learn to be more attractive to employers, like Docker, Kubernetes, and Erlang Fault-tolerance.
  - Learn Physics: Prepare myself for a future career in Quantum Information Theory.

  But I was worried. If I don't make a schedule, I won't do work on some goals because I'll get caught on others and forget to switch contexts. On the other hand, if I make my schedule and then something comes up I didn't expect, I fall behind on my goals and end up just continuing the current goal I'm on and throwing away the rest. To avoid both of those traps, I automated my workflow so each day I can specify which goals I want to work on, any miscellaneous events or goals I need to do, and for how long so that each day is customized to what is going on then. For example, I can't have a repeating schedule because I don't always start the day at the same time.

  I ended up making a series of apps written in JavaScript, the most crucial one being the Dynamic Schedule app, which allows me to use the basic interface features of my Macbook Pro and create my schedule which is then saved in my calendar. I read from a JSON my desired recurring and miscellaneous goals, and then allow the user (myself) to choose from the list of goals a subset that I want to work on. Then, one by one I can choose which to prioritize first (higher priority goals will be scheduled first). I can add miscellaneous goals and events, with custom time durations and they are automatically saved to my calendar for that day. The nice thing I also coded was keeping track of miscellaneous goal.

  Let's say I wanted to create a simple but fun Macbook Pro game, using the Script Editor (which I used for these JavaScript apps) but I ran out of time for that day to finish it. My memory is not all powerful, so there is a good chance the next day I'll forget I had that goal. The scheduling app saves all miscellaneous goals I add to a JSON so then on the next day when I go to schedule my daily plan, it will show me that I had that goal.

  All of this helped me tons in staying on track to achieving my goals from Aug. to mid Sept. of 2020.

# Research
## Research & Creative Works Conference
  As another side project (February 2020), I wanted to apply the frequent pondering on factoring I had done over the past year, which had increased the past 4 months because of my discrete mathematics teaching to students as a tutor and TA. I researched a proof for the conjecture I had that to find the next integer factor of a number and test if it's factor, one could simply subtract from the last factor checked the division of that previous factor and the current integer.

  The research is presented in the form of a website on my GitHub.io here: https://benjaminrhansen.github.io/Theorem/.

  Here is the theorem.
### Theorem
    Let \(n \in \mathbb{n}\) For \(k\) = 1, \dots, \(\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\), let \(a_k\) be the real number
  such that \(a_{k}k = n\). The numbers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor}\) satisfy the recurrence relation

  \(a_k = a_{k-1} \)\minus\( \frac{a_{k-1}}{k}\)


## Multithreading: How many threads? - White Paper
   In my Operating Systems class, our final project was a research paper on how many threads are needed for a given program to maximize performance.

   Here is the file for the white paper:

# Blog

*Debugging*
Today I was doing quick coding in JavaScript, working on my Summer side project you can view here: [[https://benjaminrhansen.github.io/Portfolio/#outline-container-org4ad206c][Automate Summer Workflow]].
It was all going fairly well until I created a whole block of code I understood logically would work (or should, because it made
since to me) but it didn't. It would work on the first loop, and then not on any of the others. I was so confused. I displayed some
outputs, pondered what might be affecting the error given the message I was receiving. I made some minor changes, and still - the same bug prevailed.

So, I had to get in to the nitty-gritty and *comment every single line*. After commenting thoroughly each little
piece of the block, I got down to almost the last little bit without any idea what might have been wrong and found the bug.
I thought, what is this doing here? How did it still run once and then quit. It was very weird. After deleting that extra unneeded stuff, it worked.
###Code Snippet before

  // keep prompting for the desired order until the reamainingGoals array is
  // empty

   The RSA cryptosystem works so beautifully but I wanted to see the mathematical theory behind the guarantee that the encryption and then decryption of any encoded message will result in the original message. Here is a proof I made to verify that the message is preserved when encrypted and then decrypted.

  Recall the "players" (variables) of RSA encryption. This table was created by Rick Neff in [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-org844de28][Metaphor's Be With You]] under section "Two".


| Who | What                    | Roles/Relationships                                                 |
|-----+-------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| m   | message (plaintext)     | decrypted c: m = c^d % n                                             |
| c   | ciphertext              | encrypted m: c = m^e % n                                             |
| p   | a large prime           | where “large” is relative                                           |
| q   | another large prime     | different than p, but with the same number of digits (more or less) |
| n   | the modulus             | the product of p and q: must be bigger than m                       |
| t   | the totient             | the product of p - 1 and q - 1                                      |
| e   | the encryption exponent | must be coprime to t, typically 65537 (216 + 1)                     |
| d   | the decryption exponent | TUMMI (mod t) of e                                                  |

  I want to prove that \(m\) really does equal \(c^d \text{ mod } n\).

  Since \(c = m^e \text{ mod } n\)
\begin{aligned}
  c^d \text{ mod } n &= (m^e \text{ mod } n)^d \text{ mod } n \\
     &=(m^e \text{ mod } n) \times (m^e \text{ mod } n) \times \cdots (d \text{ times}) \\
     &=(m^e \text{ mod } n \times \cdots (d \text{ times})) \times (m^e \text{ mod } n \times \cdots (d \text{ times})) \text{ by the distributivity of modular arithmetic} \\
     &=m^{e+e+\cdots(d \text{ times})}\text{ mod } n \text{ by the property of reflexivity} \\
     &=m^{e\cdot d}\text{ mod } n \\
     &=m^{e\cdot d \text{ mod }n}\text{ mod }n \text{ by the fact that } \forall a, k, b \in \mathbb{N} : a^k \text{ mod} b \equiv a^{k \text{ mod} b}\text{ mod}b \\
     &=m
\end{aligned}
This last simplification needs some explanation, which I will explain hopefully soon...
